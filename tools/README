Some tools to get WQ records out of dsdt.

Use iasl to get a .dsl file.

Then do (where WQBB is replaced by your WQ record needed):

wmixtract.py WQBB dsdt.dsl | hexxer | mofdecompress > wqbb.mof

Clevo mof isn't available in the bios, but is available from within their hotkey drivers. Use ResourceExtract to extract it from clevomof.dll, then:

mofdecompress clevo-mof.bmf > clevo-mof.mof
